Alpha-H coding challenge: to reproduce the Alpha-H landing page from Figma mockup.

## What I enjoyed/Most proud of

- Reproducing the design accurately. It was enjoyable doing the little tweaks to get it just right. Having the Figma file to get dimensions, fonts and design details was very handy.
- Accessibility elements and the overall page structure. I tested it with VoiceOver and am happy with the flow.

## New things I learnt

- I discovered SVG colour filters when figuring out how to do a hover effect on the icons.
- Finding a px to em converter to help with my workflow.
- Building my first e-commerce layout.

## What was challenging

- Getting the hero image to sit correctly with the right aspect ratio when the browser is resized.
- Getting the hero banner text to stick to the hero image. I haven't found a solution for this just yet.

## Things to work on

- Getting proficient with CSS layouts and knowing when best to use which technique.
- Learn CSS animations.
- Learn responsive design, especially for mobile.
